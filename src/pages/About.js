            <p>The NerveGear is a streamlined helmet coated in dark blue. At the back is a long pad with a wire the same color as the NerveGear stretching out of it. It also has a battery and internal memory to store data from the games. 30% of the NerveGear's weight is from its internal battery. The headgear features three LED lights on the front rim that indicate power, network connection, and brain interface status respectively. If the brain interface status light switches to red, this signifies that the user's brain has been rendered non-functioning.</p>
